# Typescript CDK Project

#### Running the project

    ```bash
    npm run cdkwatch
    npm run tswatch
    ```

`cdkwatch` is a command that watches the CDK project for changes and rebuilds the project and deploys it to AWS
`tswatch` is a command that watches the TypeScript LAMBDA project for changes and transpiles it to JavaScript for AWS Lambda to use.

**Note**

Run BOTH in scripts for development.

Use VSCode for best experience.
